# Kona-coffee

## Inspiration

For this build I wanted to see if I could create something similar to the Starbucks homepage. As such, I created the homepage for a fictional coffee company called Kona Coffee which is influenced by the Starbucks design.  

I learned a lot of new things building out this page, including:

* Learning to use FireFox, Chrome Dev Tools more in-depth. I also learned that the answers to a lot of my questions are out there if I just look at the Dev Tools.  
* Learning to re-use classes more efficiently. In this project, a lot of the card styles are shared so I can easily add new cards in the future if needed.  
* Learning to build interactive accordions for the footer links section.  
* Finally, I tried to make some of my JS functions more modular during this build.  I attempted to seperate out some of the functions to make their uses more clear.  

Overall, this was a fun build and taught me a lot about using Dev Tools.
