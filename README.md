# Kona-coffee

## Inspiration

For this build I wanted to see if I could create something similar to the Starbucks home page. As such, I created the home page for a fictional coffee company called Kona Coffee which is influenced by the Starbucks home page design.  

I learned a lot of new things building out this page, including:

* Learning to use FireFox, Chrome Dev Tools more in depth. I learned that the answers to a lot of my questions are out there if I just look at the Dev Tools.  
* Learning to re-use classes more effectively. In this project, a lot of the card styles are shared so I can easily add more in the future if needed.  
* Working with building interactive accordions for the footer section.  
* Finally, I tried to make some of my JS functions more modular during this build.  I attempted to seperate out some of the functions to make their uses more clear.  

Overall, this was a fun build and taught me a lot about using Dev Tools.
